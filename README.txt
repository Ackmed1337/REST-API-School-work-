how to run by ahmad elsayed :)

node + mongodb(and compass) installed then:

setup mongodb compass

command prompt --> cd the server folder --> npm i ---> npm start --> open up index and test


all the information should be stored in the user file on mongodb compass
docker was used for a slight while to test trying it without installing anything


The normal url works but to access the workers/:id you need to put the actual physical id
of what you're looking for thats how it ends up working.
